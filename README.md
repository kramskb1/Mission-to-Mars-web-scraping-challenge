	I completed my initial scraping using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter. I created a Jupyter Notebook file to complete all of my scraping and analysis tasks. I scraped the NASA Mars News Site and collected the latest News Title and Paragraph Text. I assigned the text to variables that I could reference later. I visited the url for JPL Featured Space Image. I used splinter to find the image url for the current featured Mars image. I assigned the url string to a variable called featured_image_url.
	I visited the USGS Astrogeology site to obtain high resolution images for each of Marsâ€™ hemispheres. I saved the url string for the full resolution hemisphere image, and the hemisphere title containing the hemisphere name. I used a Python dictionary to store the data using the keys img_url and title. I appended the dictionary with the url string and the hemisphere title to a list. The list contained one dictionary for each hemisphere. 
	I used MongoDB with Flask Templating to create a new HTML page that displayed all of the information from the URLs. I converted my Jupyter Notebook into a Python script called scrape_mars.py. It included a function called scrape which executed all of my scraping code and returned one Python dictionary containing all of the scraped data. I created a route called /scrape that imported my scrape_mars.py and called my scrape function. I stored the return value in Mongo as a Python dictionary.
	I created a root route / that queried my Mongo database and passed the Mars data into an HTML template to display the data. I created a file called index.html that took the mars data dictionary and displayed all of the data in the appropriate HTML elements. One issue that I had when completing this assignment was the chromedriver.exe file that I was using would work one day and then not work the next day. I had to update the chromedriver I was using on multiple occasions while completing this assignment. Otherwise, the chromedriver would sometimes prevent my webpages from loading.
	My Mars image was generated. My Valles Marineris image was generated.
